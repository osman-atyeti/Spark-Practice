‚ö° What is Apache Spark?
Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed data processing engine
that provides a faster, flexible, and more powerful alternative to Hadoop MapReduce.

üí° Core Idea:
Instead of writing intermediate results to disk (like Hadoop), Spark keeps data in memory when possible, making computations much faster.

‚ö° What is the difference between Hadoop and Spark?
Hadoop is a distributed storage and processing framework, while Spark is a
data processing engine that can run on top of Hadoop or independently.

‚ö° What is the difference between Spark and MapReduce?
Spark is a data processing engine that can perform in-memory computations,
while MapReduce is a disk-based processing model. Spark is generally faster and more flexible than MapReduce.


‚öôÔ∏è 1.1.4 How Spark Runs (Architecture Preview)
We‚Äôll explore internals in 1.2, but here‚Äôs a quick view:

Spark Job Execution Flow:
You write code ‚Üí Spark builds a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of stages
The Driver Program manages the job
Executors run the actual tasks on a cluster
Cluster Managers (like YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes, or Standalone) allocate resources

Real Analogy:
Imagine a movie production:
Director = Driver
Actors = Executors
Production Studio = Cluster Manager
Movie Script = DAG
